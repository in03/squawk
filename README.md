> Davinci Resolve 18.5 supports automatic subtitles natively. It is recommended to upgrade.
> If you must use an older version of Resolve and still want to use Squawk, it will still function, but there are no plans for updates.

#### Automatic subtitles for DaVinci Resolve with OpenAI Whisper :sparkles:
Save time writing subtitles yourself and don't pay an online service to do it. Squawk generates subtitles for your videos in DaVinci Resolve! 
It renders audio of your timeline, transcribes it (speech-to-text) with Whisper, and automatically imports the subtitles into Resolve. Whisper can even translate other languages into English before transcribing.

> **Note**
>
> Currently only Resolve 18 is supported. Resolve 17 and older require Python 3.6, which is now EOL. Some dependencies have started dropping support for it. A Resolve 17 branch doesn't currently exist, and will not unless someone asks nicely for it or forks the project.

## Installation
Install with pipx
```
pipx install git+https://github.com/in03/squawk
```

## Usage
Simply run:
```
squawk timeline
```
to render, transcribe and import the subtitles of the active timeline.

You can pass "Timeline Name" as an optional argument to select a specific timeline:
```
squawk timeline "My Timeline"
```
If you already have the file you're transcribing rendered, pass the file:
```
squawk file "My File.mov"
```

### Transcription Accuracy
Depending on the quality of your audio, you can try different language models. The larger the model, the higher chance of an accurate transcription, but the slower the analysis. You can choose the model used in the user configuration file. 

If your audio is clear and high-quality like a professional VO, you might get away just fine with the `tiny` model. If your audio contains dialogue with lots of sound effects, music and people talking over each other, you might want to start with `medium`. Try `large` as a last resort if the transcription contains a lot of incorrect words. 

You can see a comparison of Whisper's language models [here](https://github.com/openai/whisper/blob/main/model-card.md).
